# Self-Driving Car Image Segmentation for Indian Roadways

This project focuses on building an end-to-end image segmentation model aimed at enhancing self-driving car systems in Indiaâ€™s diverse road environments. Using a dataset of over 10,000 annotated images across 40 classes, the model addresses challenges such as class imbalance and complex road conditions.

## Key Features:
- **U-Net Architecture:** Utilized a U-Net architecture with a pre-trained ResNet-34 encoder for multi-class semantic segmentation.
- **Data Augmentation:** Implemented data augmentation techniques to increase robustness and improve model performance.
- **Loss Functions:** Employed Focal Loss and Dice Loss to handle class imbalance and achieve high segmentation accuracy.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Evaluated model performance with metrics like Dice Coefficient and Intersection over Union (IoU), achieving an average Dice Coefficient of 0.9321%.

## Future Work:
- **Real-time Optimization:** Optimize the model for real-time inference on low-power edge devices.
- **Transfer Learning:** Leverage transfer learning to improve adaptability across different road conditions.
